##Kumon Methodology:
Kumon method works on the basis of regular practice. Especially math small digit addition/subtraction/multiplication is given over and over and they measure it against the time. In that way the single digit arithmatic will become a memory which will in turn speed up the overall math solution time. This Excel is built to replace that methodology
